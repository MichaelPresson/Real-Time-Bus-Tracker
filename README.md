# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
#Description
In this exercise we used an API to receive real time bus location information to create a bus tracker for buses around the MIT campus.

#How to Run
To run: clone this repository and load the index.html file into your code editor of choice.
At the top where it says "token", enter your token from Mapbox.
Once you have entered your token, load the index.html file into the browser and watch the bus locations update every 15 seconds.

#Roadmap
In the future I would like to change the location and maybe see what other kinds of transportation organizations offer their information live to be used like this. Maybe airplanes?
